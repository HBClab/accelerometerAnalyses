# HBC lab accelerometer analysis


# Accelerometer materials on the server

The scripts and data output for the procedures described here are located on our server at:
`/Volumes/vosslabhpc/Projects/Accelerometer`

**Document history:** The manual was initially developed and written as a word document by Lauren Reist and Rachel Clark Cole, and updated by Lauren and Abby Mickley in August 2018. As of March 2019, we are putting the manual into a markdown file so that we can more easily track changes collaborative edits time. 


# Data collection and storage

## Device maintenance and check-out 

* **Maintaining the devices:** Accelerometer batteries should never be allowed to die completely.  If they are not being used regularly, they should be charged on a regular basis.

* **Choosing the device to use:**: Give out the accelerometers in order of their labelID as much as possible. Tis ensures you are charging them regularly and helps you keep track of them.  

* **Identify LabID of the participant:** Before collecting data, the ActiGraph device needs to be initialized with subject-specific information. Use Lab ID for identification, rather than study IDs. Obtain subject information prior to initializing the device. 

* **Tracking:** Fill out the Accelerometer Set-Up Sheet with the subject information, cross off when you have set that accelerometer. After you have set the accelerometer, fill out the Accelerometer Tracking Sheet. You will finish filling this out when the accelerometer is returned.  

* **Software:** ActiLife should be used from the hbclab account (login: hbclab , password: see lab manager/exercise specialist for password). 



## Initializing the accelerometer before use

### Initialize a device: 
1. Note that Accelerometers must have a battery level over 80% to be initialized.   
2. Open Actilife software.  
3. Make sure that any data currently on the device is already downloaded and stored because the initialization process will delete any data currently stored on the device  
4. Select “Devices” tab  
5. Make sure the checkbox on the left under “device” is checked. **Note** if more than 1 accelerometer is in the charging port, make sure to check the device list to be sure you are setting the correct one.  

> **TIP** If you need to set more than 1 accelerometer for the same dates and times for 2 or more people, you can set them at the same time, BUT they have to be for the same dates and times!

6. Click “Initialization” tab, then click “Regular Initialization”
*  Set appropriate start/stop date and time in the pop up window

    * Double check that device time is same as computer time

	* Check the “Use Stop Time?” box

	* The accelerometers should be set to record from 12:00 am to 12:00 am over 7 days. There will be a few times when you may set them to record for fewer days, but the most common is 7 days. 

    > Example:  if you are giving the accelerometer out on 6/13/2018, the device would be set to  start recording on 6/14/2018 at 12:00 am and stop recording at 6/21/2018 at 12:00 am.

    
* Set **Sample rate** to 60 Hz. Sample rate should already be set at 60 hz, but double check to make sure. 
* Do **not check** the “Enable Wireless” or “Heart Rate” boxes under “Wireless Options”
* Set **Idle Sleep Mode** to Enabled
* Check the box beside **Show Display** and click Options
    * Show 24 and show subject feedback. Verify that no boxes are checked 
    * Click Accept

7. **Do not** check the box beside “Enable IMU”

8. Click **Subject Info** on the bottom right of the pop-up window. This information should be on your set up sheet.
* Enter information under appropriate column
* To keep information anonymous, use Lab ID as subject name.
* Select **Wrist** under Limb, enter subject-appropriate side and select “Non-Dominant” under Dominance (the device should always be worn on the subject’s non-dominant hand)
> **TIP** Double check the entered data!

9. Click **Initialize Device** on the bottom right of the window
* The status bar will say **finished initializing** when it is completed

10. Remove it from the USB connection and place it directly into the wristband.  
* You will have 10 seconds to get it in the wristband once you remove it from the charging port.  
* The wristband should be laying flat on the desk.  
* Once the accelerometer is in the wrist band, do not move or touch the band until the count down has stopped.
* It is now ready for data acquisition.

11. Fill out the data collection form to give to the participant along with the accelerometer

12. Add the accelerometer to the Tracking sheet.  This allows us to know where all devices are at all times.
