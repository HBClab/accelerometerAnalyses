# HBC lab accelerometer analysis


# Accelerometer materials on the server

The scripts and data output for the procedures described here are located on our server at:
`/Volumes/vosslabhpc/Projects/Accelerometer`

**Document history:** The manual was initially developed and written as a word document by Lauren Reist and Rachel Clark Cole, and updated by Lauren and Abby Mickley in August 2018. As of March 2019, we are putting the manual into a markdown file so that we can more easily track changes collaborative edits time. 


# Data collection and storage

## Device maintenance and check-out 

* **Maintaining the devices:** Accelerometer batteries should never be allowed to die completely.  If they are not being used regularly, they should be charged on a regular basis.

* **Choosing the device to use:**: Give out the accelerometers in order of their labelID as much as possible. Tis ensures you are charging them regularly and helps you keep track of them.  

* **Identify LabID of the participant:** Before collecting data, the ActiGraph device needs to be initialized with subject-specific information. Use Lab ID for identification, rather than study IDs. Obtain subject information prior to initializing the device. 

* **Tracking:** Fill out the Accelerometer Set-Up Sheet with the subject information, cross off when you have set that accelerometer. After you have set the accelerometer, fill out the Accelerometer Tracking Sheet. You will finish filling this out when the accelerometer is returned.  

* **Software:** ActiLife should be used from the hbclab account (login: hbclab , password: see lab manager/exercise specialist for password).
